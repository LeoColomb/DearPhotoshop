## What

Inspired from [Dear Photograph](http://dearphotograph.com/) website creation, this tool aims to automate
the process.

## How

* You need a good picture (a photography)
* You need a pic of a hand (this is the hard point)
* [Download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoColomb/DearPhotoshop/master/src/DearPhotoshop.atn) and import it in Photoshop
* Execute the script on the original photography
* Import the hand
* Wouaouh!
