_This script/project is originaly build for **Adobe Photoshop CS6**._

* You need a good picture (a photography)
* You need a pic of a hand (this is the hard point)
* [Download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoColomb/DearPhotoshop/master/src/DearPhotoshop.atn) and import it in Photoshop
* Open the original photography and make a selection where the _mise en abime_ will be inserted
* Execute the script
* Import and place the hand
* Wouaouh!
